latency-tester
==============

A simple Python script to ping a server (Google by default) to test for latency issues. Includes a threshold setting allowing you to log entries that take longer than X milliseconds. Created with love by FlipperPA fueled by his loathing of Comcast.

Requies python and the python library pexpect, available by pip install.
